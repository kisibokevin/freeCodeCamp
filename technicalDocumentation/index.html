                <h3>Tags, attributes, and elements</h3>
                <p><strong>Tags:</strong> HTML tags are used to define elements in an HTML document. They consist of an opening tag,
                    content, and a closing tag. For example, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is the opening tag for a paragraph element, and
                    <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> is the closing tag.
                </p>
                
                <p><strong>Attributes:</strong> HTML attributes provide additional information about an element. They are added to the
                    opening tag and are written as name-value pairs. For example, the <code>href</code> attribute in an
                    <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag specifies the URL of the link.
                </p>
                
                <p><strong>Elements:</strong> Elements are the building blocks of HTML documents, consisting of an opening tag, content,
                    and a closing tag (in the case of non-void elements). Examples of elements include headings (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>
                    to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>), paragraphs (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>), links (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>), images
                    (<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>), and lists (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>).
                </p>

            <div class="semantic-html">
                <h3>Semantic HTML</h3>
                <p>
                    Semantic HTML refers to using HTML elements that convey meaning beyond their appearance. By using semantic elements
                    appropriately, you provide more context to the content of your web page, which is beneficial for accessibility,
                    search
                    engine optimization (SEO), and maintainability.
                    <br>
                    Examples of semantic HTML elements include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>&lt;header&gt;</span> - Defines a header section for a document.</li>
                    <li><span>&lt;nav&gt;</span> - Defines a navigation section for a document.</li>
                    <li><span>&lt;main&gt;</span> - Defines the main content of a document.</li>
                    <li><span>&lt;footer&gt;</span> - Defines a footer section for a document.</li>
                    <li><span>&lt;article&gt;</span> - Defines an article.</li>
                    <li><span>&lt;section&gt;</span> - Defines a section in a document.</li>
                    <li><span>&lt;aside&gt;</span> - Defines content aside from the page content.</li>
                    <li><span>&lt;address&gt;</span> - Defines contact information for the author/owner of a document.</li>
                    <li><span>&lt;figure&gt;</span> - Defines self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code
                        snippets, etc.</li>
                    <li><span>&lt;figcaption&gt;</span> - Defines a caption for a &lt;figure&gt; element.</li>
                    <li><span>&lt;mark&gt;</span> - Defines marked/highlighted text.</li>
                    <li><span>&lt;time&gt;</span> - Defines a date/time.</li>
                    <li><span>&lt;details&gt;</span> - Defines additional details that the user can view or hide.</li>
                    <li><span>&lt;summary&gt;</span> - Defines a visible heading for a &lt;details&gt; element.</li>
                    <li><span>&lt;form&gt;</span> - Defines an HTML form for user input.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Using semantic HTML not only helps assistive technologies understand the structure of your content better but also
                    improves the overall readability and maintainability of your code.
                    <br>
                    Understanding these fundamental concepts of HTML is essential for anyone starting their journey in web development.

            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in
            HTML. In this section, we'll cover the basics of styling HTML elements, CSS selectors and specificity, and commonly used
            layout techniques such as flexbox and grid.

                <h3>Styling Elements</h3>
                <p>
                    CSS allows you to control the visual presentation of HTML elements, including their layout, colors, fonts, and more.
                    Styles can be applied inline, internally within a <code>style</code> element in the HTML document,
                    or externally in a separate CSS file. Here's an example of how to style HTML elements using CSS:
                    <br>
                    Here's an example of how to style HTML elements using CSS:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        /* Selects all paragraph elements and sets the font size to 16 pixels */
                        p {
                        font-size: 16px;
                        }
                        
                        /* Selects all elements with the class 'highlight' and sets the background color to yellow */
                        .highlight {
                        background-color: yellow;
                        }
                        
                        /* Selects the element with the ID 'header' and sets the text color to blue */
                        #header {
                        color: blue;
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>
            <div class="css-selectors">
                <h3>CSS Selectors and Specificity</h3>
                <div class="css-selectors-specificity">
                    <p>CSS selectors are patterns used to select and style elements in an HTML document. Selectors can target elements based on
                    their tag names, classes, IDs, attributes, and relationships with other elements.
                    <br>
                    Specificity refers to the mechanism by which browsers decide which CSS rules apply to an element. Specificity is
                    determined by the type of selector used and any additional qualifiers such as classes, IDs, or inline styles.
                    <br>
                    For example:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A <span>class</span> selector has the highest specificity.</li>
                        <li>An <span>ID</span> selector has the next highest specificity.</li>
                        <li>An <span>inline style</span> selector has the lowest specificity.</li>
                        <li>A <span>tag name</span> selector has the lowest specificity.</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="layout-techniques">
                <h3>Layout Techniques (Flexbox, Grid)</h3>
                <p>Modern CSS provides powerful layout techniques for creating responsive and flexible designs. Two widely used layout
                    models are Flexbox and Grid.</p>
                
                <h2>Flexbox</h2>
                <p>Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model that allows you to align and distribute space among elements in a container
                    along a single axis (either horizontally or vertically). Flexbox is ideal for creating responsive layouts and
                    aligning items within a container.</p>
                <div class="container">
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                        .container {
                            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;display: flex;
                            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;justify-content: center; /* Align items horizontally */
                            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;align-items: center; /* Align items vertically */
                            <br>}
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
                
                <h2>Grid</h2>
                <p>CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system that enables you to create complex grid-based layouts with rows
                    and columns. Grid layout provides precise control over the placement and sizing of elements within a grid container,
                    making it suitable for designing intricate page layouts.</p>
                <div class="grid-container">
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            .grid-container {
                                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;display: grid;
                                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; /* Two columns with equal width */
                                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;grid-gap: 20px; /* Spacing between grid items */
                                <br>}
                        </code>

            <header>Introduction to JavaScript</header>
            <p>JavaScript is a versatile programming language widely used for creating dynamic and interactive web applications. In
                this section, we'll cover fundamental concepts including variables, data types, operators, control structures such
                as loops and conditionals, and functions with their associated scope.
            </p>
            
            <h2>1. Variables, Data Types, and Operators:</h2>
            <p><strong>Variables:</strong> Variables are containers for storing data values. In JavaScript, variables can be
                declared using the var, let, or const keywords.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>var name = "John";
            let age = 30;
            const PI = 3.14;</code>
            </pre>
            <p><strong>Data Types:</strong> JavaScript supports several data types including numbers, strings, booleans, objects,
                arrays, and more.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>let num = 10;
            let str = "Hello, World!";
            let isTrue = true;
            let person = { name: "John", age: 30 };
            let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p><strong>Operators:</strong> JavaScript provides various operators for performing operations on values, such as
                arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), assignment operators (=, +=, -=), comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==),
                logical operators (&&, ||, !), and more.</p>
            <pre><code>let sum = 5 + 3;
            let isGreater = 10 > 5;
            let result = (true && false) || true;</code></pre>
            
            <h2>2. Control Structures (Loops, Conditionals):</h2>
            <p><strong>Loops:</strong> Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met.
                JavaScript supports different types of loops including for, while, and do-while.</p>
            <pre><code>// for loop
            for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                console.log(i);
            }
            
            // while loop
            let count = 0;
            while (count < 5) {
                console.log(count);
                count++;
            }</code></pre>
            <p><strong>Conditionals:</strong> Conditionals are used to make decisions in code based on certain conditions.
                JavaScript provides if, else if, and else statements for implementing conditionals.</p>
            <pre><code>let num = 10;
            if (num > 0) {
                console.log("Positive");
            } else if (num < 0) {
                console.log("Negative");
            } else {
                console.log("Zero");
            }</code></pre>
            
            <h2>3. Functions and Scope:</h2>
            <p><strong>Functions:</strong> Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. In JavaScript,
                functions can be declared using the function keyword or as arrow functions.</p>
            <pre><code>// Function declaration
            function greet(name) {
                return "Hello, " + name + "!";
            }
            
            // Arrow function
            let add = (a, b) => a + b;</code></pre>
            <p><strong>Scope:</strong> Scope refers to the accessibility of variables in different parts of the code. JavaScript has
                two types of scope: global scope and local scope. Variables declared inside a function have local scope, while
                variables declared outside of any function have global scope.</p>
            <pre><code>let globalVar = "I'm a global variable";
            
            function exampleFunction() {
                let localVar = "I'm a local variable";
                console.log(globalVar); // Accessible
                console.log(localVar); // Accessible
            }
            
            console.log(globalVar); // Accessible
            console.log(localVar); // Error: localVar is not defined</code></pre>
            
            <p>Understanding these fundamental concepts of JavaScript is essential for building dynamic and interactive web
                applications. In the following sections, we'll explore more advanced JavaScript features and best practices for
                developing robust web solutions.</p>

            <p>JavaScript plays a crucial role in frontend development by enabling interactivity and dynamic behavior on web pages.
                Here are some common ways JavaScript is used to handle user interactions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Event Handling:</strong> JavaScript allows you to respond to user actions such as clicks, keypresses,
                    mouse movements, and form submissions using event listeners.</li>
                <li><strong>DOM Manipulation:</strong> JavaScript can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically
                    update the content, structure, and styles of web pages based on user interactions.</li>
                <li><strong>AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML):</strong> AJAX enables web pages to send and receive data from a
                    server asynchronously without reloading the entire page, providing a smoother and more interactive user
                    experience.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By leveraging JavaScript, developers can create engaging and interactive web applications that respond to user input
                in real-time.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Introduction to Responsive Design:</h2>
            <p>Responsive design is an approach to web design that ensures a website's layout and content adapt gracefully to
                different screen sizes, resolutions, and device capabilities. Key principles of responsive design include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fluid Layouts:</strong> Designing layouts using relative units such as percentages and viewport width
                    (vw) to ensure content adjusts fluidly across different screen sizes.</li>
                <li><strong>Media Queries:</strong> Using CSS media queries to apply different styles based on device
                    characteristics such as screen width, orientation, and resolution.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexible Images and Media:</strong> Employing techniques such as max-width: 100% and srcset attributes
                    for images and media to ensure they scale appropriately on various devices.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By embracing responsive design principles, developers can create websites that provide an optimal viewing experience
                across desktops, tablets, and smartphones, improving accessibility and user satisfaction.</p>
            
            <p>Frontend development encompasses a broad range of skills and technologies, from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                fundamentals to advanced frameworks and responsive design techniques. Mastering these concepts is essential for
                building modern and user-friendly web applications. In the following sections, we'll delve deeper into frontend
                development tools, best practices, and advanced topics.</p>

        <section id="introduction_to_backend_development" class="main-section">
            <header>Introduction to Backend Development</header>
            <p>Backend development involves building the server-side of web applications, managing data, and handling server-client
                communication. In this section, we'll cover the fundamentals of backend development, including server-side scripting
                languages such as Node.js, Python, and PHP, an introduction to databases with a comparison of SQL vs. NoSQL, and the
                concept of RESTful APIs for facilitating server-client communication.</p>
            
            <h2>1. Server-side Scripting Languages:</h2>
            <p>Server-side scripting languages are used to write the logic and functionality that run on the server. Some popular
                server-side scripting languages include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Node.js:</strong> Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows
                    developers to write server-side applications using JavaScript, offering non-blocking, event-driven architecture
                    ideal for building scalable and high-performance web servers.</li>
                <li><strong>Python:</strong> Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language known for its
                    readability and ease of use. With frameworks like Django and Flask, Python is widely used for backend
                    development, offering robust libraries and tools for building web applications.</li>
                <li><strong>PHP:</strong> PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language designed for web
                    development. It's particularly well-suited for creating dynamic web pages and interacting with databases, making
                    it a popular choice for backend development in conjunction with web servers like Apache or Nginx.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These server-side scripting languages provide developers with the tools and frameworks necessary to handle requests,
                process data, and generate dynamic content for web applications.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Introduction to Databases:</h2>
            <p>Databases are used to store and manage structured data for web applications. There are two main categories of
                databases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases:</strong> SQL databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and
                    SQLite, use a relational model and SQL language for querying and manipulating data. They are characterized by
                    tables with rows and columns and support transactions and complex queries.</li>
                <li><strong>NoSQL (Not Only SQL) Databases:</strong> NoSQL databases, including MongoDB, Couchbase, and Redis, use
                    non-relational data models and offer flexible schemas suitable for handling unstructured or semi-structured
                    data. They are often used for scalable, high-performance applications and real-time data processing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on factors such as data structure, scalability requirements, and
                application use cases.</p>
            
            <h2>3. RESTful APIs and Server-Client Communication:</h2>
            <p>RESTful APIs (Representational State Transfer) are a popular architectural style for designing web APIs that enable
                communication between clients and servers. Key principles of RESTful APIs include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Resource-based Architecture:</strong> Resources (e.g., users, products) are identified by URIs (Uniform
                    Resource Identifiers) and manipulated using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).</li>
                <li><strong>Statelessness:</strong> Each request from the client to the server must contain all the necessary
                    information for the server to fulfill the request, making the server stateless and improving scalability and
                    reliability.</li>
                <li><strong>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) Format:</strong> JSON is commonly used as the data interchange format
                    for transmitting data between the client and server in RESTful API requests and responses.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By implementing RESTful APIs, developers can create standardized interfaces for accessing and manipulating data,
                enabling seamless integration between frontend and backend systems.</p>
            
            <p>Backend development is a critical component of web application development, responsible for handling business logic,
                data management, and server-side operations. Understanding server-side scripting languages, databases, and RESTful
                APIs is essential for building robust and scalable web applications. In the following sections, we'll explore
                advanced backend development concepts, tools, and best practices for building efficient and secure web services.</p>
